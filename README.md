# Student Management System.

You are required to develop a system for a new regional university that started offering
undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in Information Technology. This system will add to
the functionality of the main student system by providing extra capabilities for program
coordinators to set and maintain rules for program completion.

Coordinators and Faculty Administrator can view the
enrolments and course results for a student and then use the
system to get an immediate result whether the student has met
completion requirements for a program and so can apply to
graduate. Students also can use this system to assess their own
progress towards completion.
